### Who even are you

I am currently a PhD candidate at the University of Western Australia in Perth, Western Australia. My PhD project is about the microbiome of the upper respiratory tract in children with recurrent acute otitis media (recurrent ear infections), so I work with bacteria, genomics and bioinformatics. Constantly learning, this blog helps me remember the cool things I've worked out.

You can find detailed documentation for all of my analyses at the following links:

* [*16S rRNA amplicon study*](https://rachaellappan.github.io/16S-analysis/) and the accompanying [paper](https://bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12866-018-1154-3)

**I thought I was really clever** when I came up with [The Ordeal of Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wheel_of_Time) for a PhD/research blog title. Sorry.

This blog was set up super easily using Jekyll and hosting on GitHub pages by following [this guide](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/).
